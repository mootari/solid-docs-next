# Adding Interactivity with State

In the previous lesson, we learned how to architect a Solid application using components and JSX. We then built a Bookshelf application using our new knowledge, but it's not quite complete. In this lesson, we'll learn how to add _state_ to our app. We'll then apply this knowledge to our Bookshelf application to bring it to life.

## A note on primitives

As we proceed through these tutorials, we'll start hearing about Solid _primitives_. 
While components are the building blocks of _views_ in Solid apps, primitives are the building blocks of _interactivity_.
The first primitive that we'll be learning about is the _signal_.

## Managing basic state with signals

In Solid, the most basic way to manage state in our application is to use a _signal_. To create a signal, Solid provides a `createSignal` function:

```tsx
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";

const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);
```

There's a lot going on here: first, we call `createSignal` with the initial value of state. In this case, our `count` is going to start at `0`. The `createSignal` function returns a two-element array and we use JavaScript _destructuring assignment_ to unpack this array. In this case, we assign the first element to a variable called `count` and the second element to a variable called `setCount`.

The first element, `count`, is an _accessor_ function (also referred to as a _getter_) that returns the current value of state.

It's important to note that this is a _function that gets the current value_, rather than the value itself. Along the way, this function call tells Solid to take note that we've accessed the signal here.

```tsx
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";

const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

console.log(count()); // 0
```

<FrameworkAside framework="svelte">
  This is equivalent to `let count = 0` in Svelte.

In Svelte, you can use your
reactive value without calling it like a function. That's because Svelte's
reactivity uses a compiler, whereas Solid's reactivity is part of the library.
Because we're working within the restrictions of JavaScript, we need to run code when we access the value so that we can
tell the reactive system, "This value is used here!"

</FrameworkAside>
<FrameworkAside framework="react">
This is equivalent to `const [count, setCount] = useState(0)` in React.

In React, you can use your reactive value without calling it like a function.
That's because React's rendering system will rerun your entire component any time any state changes - there's nothing special to set up for any individual piece of state, so there's no need to run any code when you use a reactive value.

</FrameworkAside>
<FrameworkAside framework="vue">
This is equivalent to `const count = ref(0)` in Vue.

Instead of splitting count into a getter function and a setter function, Vue has you use `count.value` for both getting and setting
the value. Vue's reactive system is similar to Solid's: we need to run code behind the scenes whenever a `ref` is accessed.
In Vue, this code lives inside the `.value` [getter function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get).

</FrameworkAside>
<FrameworkAside framework="angular">
In Angular, this might just be a class property that you mutate. This is one of the biggest differences between Solid and Angular.
While Solid relies on explicit property updates, Angular enables mutations of variables to trigger change detection.

While this might seem like pure mental overhead, there are two main benefits of Solid's read/write separation:

1. It doesn't require additional performance overhead for change detection
2. It doesn't require any additional logic (like [`runOutsideAngular`](https://angular.io/api/core/NgZone#runOutsideAngular)) to avoid change detection
</FrameworkAside>

The second element, `setCount`, is a _setter_ function. If we want to increment our `count`, we can pass `count() + 1` to `setCount`:

```tsx
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";

const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

setCount(count() + 1);

console.log(count()); // 1
```

Note that, in order to see our `count` value's new value, we added our `console.log` statement after we used `setCount`.

A key to Solid's _reactive system_ is that we don't really have to do this. Instead, we can listen for&mdash;and instantly react to&mdash;any signal changes by using our next primitive: the _effect_.

## Reacting to changes with effects

The ability to react to signal changes underpins Solid's reactive system. The most basic way to do so is to use an _effect_. We can create an effect by using the `createEffect` hook:

```tsx
import { createSignal, createEffect } from "solid-js";

const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0);

createEffect(() => {
  console.log(count());
});

setCount(count() + 1);
```

To use `createEffect`, we pass it a function. When any signals used in that function update, the function will rerun.

In this example, our effect depends on `count` and therefore the effect runs whenever `count` changes. Accordingly, we log `1` to the console just like before.

Automatic effect dependency tracking is made possible by `count` being a function. When the `count` function is called inside an effect, that effect is registered as a listener for the signal. This is why it's so important that our signals are functions!

<FrameworkAside framework="svelte">
  This is equivalent to `$: console.log(count)` in Svelte.
</FrameworkAside>
<FrameworkAside framework="react">
  In React, you'd declare the dependencies explicitly using the dependency array:
  ```js
    useEffect(() => {
      console.log(count);
    }, [count])
  ```
    If you didn't, the effect would rerun whenever _any_ state in the component changes.
    In Solid, dependencies are tracked automatically, and you don't have to worry about extra reruns.
</FrameworkAside>
<FrameworkAside framework="vue">
  This is equivalent to `watchEffect(() => console.log(count.value))` in Vue.
</FrameworkAside>
<FrameworkAside framework="angular">
    While Angular doesn't have a 1:1 comparison to Solid's `createEffect`, they're tangentially similar to Angular's [lifecycle hooks](https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks).

    However, `createEffect` has some primary benefits over lifecycle methods:
    - They can run outside of components.
    - They have a more consolidated API as a result of their decoupling from components.
    - They're "composable" (You can put an effect inside another effect)
</FrameworkAside>

## Rendering with signals

Before we get back to our bookshelf, let's see an example of how these _primitives_ can be used inside _components_.

<CodeTabs
  js={[{ name: "Counter.jsx", component: Counter1 }]}
  ts={[{ name: "Counter.tsx", component: Counter1 }]}
/>

<div>Current count: 0</div>

We see that, much like other variables, we can use signals inside our JSX code by including them inside curly braces. This component is not too interesting yet; so let's add the ability to increment our count. We can do this by adding a `<button>` element and giving it a _click handler_ using the `onClick` attribute. This click handler will increment our count by using the `setCount` function:

<CodeTabs
  js={[{ name: "Counter.jsx", component: Counter2 }]}
  ts={[{ name: "Counter.tsx", component: Counter2 }]}
/>

<BasicCounter />

And now we have a functioning counter! Notably, our text updates whenever our `count` is incremented. Does this remind you of an effect? Whenever the signal changes, the code that controls that part of the DOM reruns, similar to how the code in our effect reran whenever `count` changed.

Behind the scenes, Solid's compiler creates effects based on our JSX. It sees that we're using `count()` in a specific part of the DOM, and it creates an effect that updates just that part of the DOM when the signal reruns.
 
A driving philosophy of Solid is that, by treating everything as a signal or an effect, we can better reason about our application.

## Revisiting the bookshelf

We now have the tools necessary to make our Bookshelf application interactive. As a refresher, here's the current state of the app with the following components:

- `BookList`, a list of books on our Bookshelf
- `AddBook`, a form that will allow us to add more books to the shelf
- `Bookshelf`, our main application component that contains the other two

<CodeTabs
  js={[
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App2js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList1 },
    
]}ts={[
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App2ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList1 },
    ]}
/>

As a first step to adding interactivity, let's add a signal that keeps track of our book list. We'll call it `books` and it will live in the `BookList` component. Each book will have a `title` and an `author`.

<CodeTabs
  js={[
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App2js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList*.jsx", component: BookList2js, default: true },
    
]}ts={[
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App2ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList*.tsx", component: BookList2ts, default: true },
    ]}
/>

There are a couple of things to note here:

First, while we had only used `createSignal` to maintain the value of a number in state thus far, it can manage all kinds of state. In our Bookshelf application, our signal is an array of objects.

Second, we're now using `books` directly in our JSX code. We call `books()` to access the signal array, and then access the element at index 0 (zero) of that array in the first list item and the element at index 1 of that array in the second list item. This will work, but it's not flexible: we want to handle a dynamic number of books.

## Looping over items

The best way to loop over items in Solid is the `<For />` component. The `<For />` component has an `each` prop, to which we can pass our `books()` array.

```tsx
<For each={books()}></For>
```

Inside the `For` component, we use a _callback function_ that will be applied to _each_ element in the array. In this instance, we want each `book` to be rendered inside an `<li>`.

```tsx
<For each={books()}>
  {(book) => {
    return (
      <li>
        {book.title} ({book.author})
      </li>
    );
  }}
</For>
```

<FrameworkAside framework="react">
In React, we'd use `array.map`:
```jsx
{books.map(book => <li key={book.title}>{book.title} ({book.author}</li>)}
```

If we used `array.map` here in Solid, _every element_ inside the book would have to rerender whenever the `books` signal changes.
The `For` component checks the array when it changes, and only updates the necessary element. It's the same kind of checking that React's VDOM rendering system does for us when we use `.map`.

Note that, unlike in React, we don't need to provide a `key` to the `For` component: it compares each element by reference.
</FrameworkAside>

<FrameworkAside framework="vue">
The above would be written as the following in Vue:

```html
<li v-for="book of books" key="book.title">{{book.title}} ({{book.author}})</li>
```

Note that, unlike in Vue, we don't need to provide a `key` to the `For` component: it compares each element by reference.
</FrameworkAside>

<FrameworkAside framework="svelte">
The above would be written as the following in Svelte:

```svelte
{#each books as book (book.title) }
  <li>{book.title} ({book.author})</li>
{#each}
```

Note that, unlike in Svelte, we don't need to provide a `key` to the `For` component: it compares each element by reference.
</FrameworkAside>

Our `BookList` component now looks like this:

<CodeTabs
  js={[
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App2js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList3js, default: true },
    
]}ts={[
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App2ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList3ts, default: true },
    ]}
/>
## Derived state

Solid makes it easy to track _derived state_. You can think of derived state as a computation based only on other information you're already tracking in state. In our Bookshelf application, an example of derived state would be the number of books on our list: it's the length of our `books` array at any point in time.

In Solid, all we have to do to compute derived state is to create a _derived signal_: a function that relies on another signal:

```tsx
const totalBooks = () => books().length;
```

Now, whenever we call `totalBooks()`, Solid will register the underlying signal (`books`) as a dependency, so the computed value will always stay up-to-date.

<CodeTabs
  js={[
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App2js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList4js, default: true },
    
]}ts={[
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App2ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList4ts, default: true },
    ]}
/>

<FrameworkAside framework="vue">
  In Vue, you might write:

  ```vue
    const totalBooks = computed(() => books.length)
  ```

  This creates a spot in memory for the computed value, and that memory is continually updated as `books` changes.
  So, if you used `{{totalBooks}}` twice in your template, `books.length` would only be called once.
  Derived signals in Solid don't create a spot in memory; every time `totalBooks()` is called, it will rerun the code `books().length`.
  Solid has another feature for this: `createMemo`, which will only rerun the computation when the dependency changes.

```js
import { createMemo } from "solid-js";

const totalBooks = createMemo(() => books().length);
```

</FrameworkAside>

<FrameworkAside framework="svelte">
In Svelte, you might write:
```svelte
	$: totalBooks = books.length;

```

</FrameworkAside>

## Lifting state up

We want to add a book to the list using our `AddBook` component. There's one problem though: how do we make the `setBooks` setter available to the `AddBooks` component?

We know that parents can pass props to children, but how do _sibling_ components pass props to each other? This is a common problem in Solid and the solution is generally to _lift state up_ to a common parent. In this case, our `books` signal can live in the `Bookshelf` component. Then, the `BookList` component can be passed the data from the getter.

Let's start out by lifting our `books` signal up to `Bookshelf` and passing its value back down to the `BookList` component. You can see the changes we have made in both the `App.tsx` and `BookList.tsx` files.

<CodeTabs
  js={[
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App3js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList5js },
    
]}ts={[
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App3ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx", component: AddBook1 },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList5ts },
    ]}
/>

Our array of books now lives in the `Bookshelf` component. We then pass `books()` to the `BookList` component. We can now access our books within the `BookList` component by using `props.books`.

<Aside type="note">
 You may have noticed that we called `books()` when we passed it to the `BookList` component&mdash;this is not a typo! In Solid, it's a best practice to call a signal accessor when you pass it to a component. In the background, Solid makes this a _reactive prop_ and reactivity will be tracked in the child component's JSX. (_TODO: good place to link to a discussion/guide on props and reactivity_).
</Aside>

## Adding books to the list

Now that we have lifted state, we can add some books to the list. Let's pass our setter to the `AddBook` component and call `setBooks` when we click the `Add Book` button. You can see these changes in the `App.tsx` and `AddBook.tsx` files:

<CodeTabs
  js={[
      { name: "App.jsx*", component: App4js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx*", component: AddBook2js },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList5js },
    
]}ts={[
      { name: "App.tsx*", component: App4ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx*", component: AddBook2ts },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList5ts },
    ]}
/>

Inside `AddBook`, we created a function called `addBook` that is used as the _click handler_ for our form's button. Since we're submitting a real HTML form, we use `event.preventDefault()` to prevent the default form behavior of executing a post request. Next, we call `props.setBooks`, but we don't quite know what to pass to our setter.

We know we want to keep the existing books on the list and then add a new book that comes from our form input. To get the existing books, we could use two different approaches: we _could_ pass the `books` signal down to our `AddBook` component. While that would work, it's worth exploring the second option: using the _callback function_ form of the setter. We haven't used this yet, and the syntax is as follows:

```tsx
setCount((currentCount) => {
  return currentCount + 1;
});
```

By using this form, our setter has access to the current value of the signal.

This form for our `setBooks` function solves the first problem: our `addBook` function can be written as follows:

```jsx
const addBook = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  props.setBooks((books) => {
    return books;
  });
};
```

Now, we need to append the text from our form inputs to this list. To do so, we can create a new signal inside the `AddBook` component to track the value of the inputs. We'll make sure this signal is always equal to the inputs' values by using its `onInput` handler. Additionally, we'll _bind_ the `newBook()` to the `value` attribute of our `input` to make sure our `input` always reflects the value of the signal.

Finally, we want to add the `newBook` to our books list and then clear the input field in case our user has more books to enter.

<CodeTabs
  js={[
      { name: "App.jsx", component: App4js },
      { name: "AddBook.jsx*", component: AddBook3js, default: true },
      { name: "BookList.jsx", component: BookList5js },
    
]}ts={[
      { name: "App.tsx", component: App4ts },
      { name: "AddBook.tsx*", component: AddBook3ts, default: true },
      { name: "BookList.tsx", component: BookList5ts },
    ]}
/>

<Aside type="note">
We used the spread operator to create an new books array inside our books setter. This is a common pattern in Solid and helps to make sure we create a new array rather than update (or _mutate_) the existing signal array. By default, Solid uses referential equality checks when determining if a signal has updated.
</Aside>

## Test-driving our app

We now have a dynamic Bookshelf application! Try it out yourself: you should be able to add books using the `AddBook` component and see those books added to the list in the `BookList` component.

<BasicBookshelf name="Solid" />
